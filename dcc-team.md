# TU DELFT DIGITAL COMPETENCE CENTRE

## Support for data and software required by 21st-century research

> Many researchers have learned the importance of good data management and software engineering in a hard way. When research outputs are no findable, code is no readable, or data published on papers is not easy to access; researchers struggle in their work because science relies on the work done by others.



## What is the DCC? 

The Digital Competence Centre (DCC) is an on-campus initiative set up to coordinate the support on data management and software engineering required for 21st-century research. We help researchers to develop the competencies needed to do FAIR research and provide hands-on support for implementing data management workflows and developing research software. The DCC is an initiative of the Open Science Program at TU Delft to help researchers at all levels.

Today like never before, researchers at TU Delft produce software and large datasets as part of their research outputs. Making such datasets and software easier to find and reuse benefits a wider research community; efficient data storage and management help researcher to extend the value of their outputs beyond personal use.  



Reproducibility has become an essential requirement of Open Science, and research projects often require developing specific software for data processing, modelling or simulation. Such software can go from code snippets, scripts, libraries, prototypes or even fully-fleshed applications. Like data, not all the software produced is easy to maintain and reuse. Developing such software under the FAIR principles and publishing it as open-source will not only make research software reproducible by the research community, but it will help you find peers for co-developing.



## The [FAIR or DCC, if we do more than FAIR, DCC is better] Support Team



The DCC is the home of a Support Team consisting of data managers and research software engineers based in the TU Delft Library and ICT/Innovation department, respectively. The team’s purpose is helping researchers to develop skills to apply the FAIR principles to their research activities and reach their software development goals. The support team is an addition to the task force supporting Open Science at TU Delft, which also includes the Faculty’s ICT Managers and Data Stewards. 



The support team of the DCC can provide researchers with IT skills, good practices and toolsets required for implementing the FAIR principles into any research project. Adopting the FAIR principles into your research project will increase the relevance and value of your research outputs (publications, data, code, etc.). Research funding bodies and open access journals are increasingly asking researchers to make their research outputs FAIR. At TU Delft, the Open Science Programme is committed to making open research and education a daily practice, and the DCC is part of that commitment.



The support team also accepts assignments to work closely with the research teams at TU Delft for a short period. This type of support is aimed at research projects which see the development of scientific software as one of their outcomes. [MENTIONED 1 OR 2 CONCRETE EXAMPLES?] Or research projects that, because of their nature, demand expert advice on the design and implementation of data management workflow for doing research-outputs reusable and interoperable. [DO WE NEED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC?].



## DCC/FAIR Team in Action [This could be displayed as three columns text, with the heading suggested at the end of each paragraph]

The DCC/FAIR Support Team is already working with several research projects at TU Delft.  Researchers are realising the value of adopting basic practices in data management, such as metadata archiving and shared repositories. The team is making a positive impact in streamlining the scientific workflows that require collaboration and organisation of many datasets. [Streamline of Scientific Workflows]

Training and mentorship on digital competencies such as version control is also a significant gain for researchers working on projects that demand migration of programing language. Changing the source core of scientific software to easier and more popular languages, such as Python, increases the adoption and reusability of research software by the scientific community. [Training and Mentorship]

Lastly, researchers are also seeing the benefits of applying good practices for documentation and maintenance of source code, even when they are skilful in programming and have developed full-fleshed programs. The proper documentation of their software makes it easier to access, reuse it and attract new users. [Software Documentation]




## How we help? 



Any researcher at TU Delft, including postdoctoral researchers and PhD students, can request support from our team of Data Managers or Research Software Engineers. You can get in contact via dcc@tudelft.nl

Our support comes in two flavours: 

•   **Questions** – send your questions anytime via e-mail. Our team will reply to you or find the right person to give you an answer. Alternatively, consult our FAQ [Link to FAQ page/document. If not ready, remove this sentence].

•   **Consultation Hour** – send us a meeting request. We can discuss your specific needs for data management or software engineering, and provide advice on the best way to support your research project (up to 30 hours of consultation). [It is not so clear for whom this type of support is meant, for researchers writing proposals?, advice on toolsets?]

•   **Project Support** – Apply for our extended support for your research projects (up to 640 hours). We can come ‘on board’ and work with you! You can apply for project support only on specific dates. Check when you can apply [Link to the application form page, which if not open should say something on when the calls will be open again. Leve the list of requirements and conditions for the page]



## We are also active as part of the Open Science Community [link to].
